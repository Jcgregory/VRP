# VRP
Vehicle Routing Problem
The goal of this entire setup was to run three different codes, having three different types of alogrithms, and to check which one was the fastest and most accurate in executing the given input dataset.
Every alogorithm had it's pros and cons, and each had a seperate area where it was better than the other alogrithms. For Example, CWS was able to generate the routes faster compared to the other two, wheras Constraint Programming was the most accurate due to it's Linear Programming abilities.
